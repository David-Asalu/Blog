        Qualcomm will leverage the ubiquity of its CPUs to connect Snapdragon devices to handle demanding workloads.

        In a keynote address at COMPUTEX, Alex Katouzian, SVP and General Manager for Mobile, Compute, and XR at Qualcomm, highlighted the prevalence of Snapdragon CPUs across various devices such as PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, and extended reality glasses. 
        
        Katouzian emphasised the increasing demand for AI workloads and the resource-intensive nature of such tasks. To address this challenge, Qualcomm aims to enable the movement of AI workloads across Snapdragon-powered devices, assuming users possess multiple devices.
        
        By offloading AI workloads to a constellation of devices, Qualcomm envisions XR glasses becoming simpler and smaller since they can rely on other devices for processing power.
        
        Kedar Kondap, Senior Vice President and General Manager for Compute and Gaming at Qualcomm, added that local devices offer better performance per watt compared to cloud data centres. As a result, he predicts that AI workloads will be shared in real-time between client devices and clouds, ensuring the best and most efficient user experience.
        
        Qualcomm’s financials have recently taken a hit due to consumer spending patterns. The impact of this on the prospects of Snapdragon-powered devices was not addressed in the keynote.
        
        While Qualcomm’s Snapdragon platform has found success in mobile devices, the company faces an uphill battle in establishing a significant presence in the PC market.
        
        Through strategic partnerships, advancements in AI capabilities, and the continuous evolution of its CPU architectures, Qualcomm aims to position itself as a serious contender and reshape the landscape of PC computing.
        
        The session concluded with a promise that Qualcomm’s next-generation Oryon CPU architecture would be available in 2024, although no further details were provided.
