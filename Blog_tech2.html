        Our reviewers were happy to see another phone from the Infinix stable cross our desks. Several of our younger team members are still using previous iterations of the phone for their daily snaps and messaging with friends. They like the relative durability and pretty good photos and image quality. Their life times have been decent to good, and they have mastered the mechanics of using them.

        In this context they were keen to road test this device too. In many ways this age group, 15-25 might be the ideal and intended user demographic for this device. Give or take the latest shop prices this is an affordable phone, not bottom of the bucket budget, but equally much less than half a thousand euros too, probably coming in at around 250 euros. This means you can use it to send junior off an a school trip, to keep in touch with the folks. Battery time is pretty good too. These phones are bright, cheerful and not particularly clunky. They may not be widely known yet, but they are definitely popular with our testing team and there is definitely some in house discussion about who gets to keep this one!
